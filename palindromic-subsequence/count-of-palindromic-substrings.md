## Problem Statement

\ques{Given a string, find the total number of palindromic substrings in it. Please note we need to find the total number of substrings and not subsequences.}

* Example 1

```Plaintext
Input: "abdbca"
Output: 7
Explanation: Here are the palindromic substrings, "a", "b", "d", "b", "c", "a", "bdb".
```

* Example 2

```Plaintext
Input: = "cddpd"
Output: 7
Explanation: Here are the palindromic substrings, "c", "d", "d", "p", "d", "dd", "dpd".
```

* Example 3

```Plaintext
Input: = "pqr"
Output: 3
Explanation: Here are the palindromic substrings,"p", "q", "r".
```

## Solution

This problem follows the [Longest Palindromic Subsequence](/palindromic-subsequence/index.html) pattern, and can be easily converted to [Longest Palindromic Substring](/palindromic-subsequence/longest-palindromic-substring/). The only difference is that instead of calculating the longest palindromic substring, we will instead count all the palindromic substrings.

Letâ€™s jump directly to the bottom-up dynamic programming solution:

### Code

Here is the code:

```python
def count_PS(st):
    n = len(st)
    # dp[i][j] will be 'true' if the string from index 'i' to index 'j' is a palindrome
    dp = [[False for _ in range(n)] for _ in range(n)]
    count = 0

    # every string with one character is a palindrome
    for i in range(n):
        dp[i][i] = True
        count += 1

    for startIndex in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
        for endIndex in range(startIndex + 1, n):
            if st[startIndex] == st[endIndex]:
                # if it's a two character string or if the remaining string is a palindrome too
                if endIndex - startIndex == 1 or dp[startIndex + 1][endIndex - 1]:
                    dp[startIndex][endIndex] = True
                    count += 1

    return count


def main():
    print(count_PS("abdbca"))
    print(count_PS("cddpd"))
    print(count_PS("pqr"))
    print(count_PS("qqq"))


main()
```

\comp{The time and space complexity of the above algorithm is $O(n^2)$, where $n$ is the length of the input string.}
